=head1 DESCRIPTION

This chapter of the tutorial explores more advanced functionality for
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) than we saw in Chapter 4.  In
particular, it looks at a number of techniques that can be useful for
the Update portion of CRUD, such as automated form generation,
validation of user-entered data, and automated transfer of data between
forms and model objects.

In keeping with the Catalyst (and Perl) spirit of flexibility, there are 
many different ways to approach advanced CRUD operations in a Catalyst 
environment.  Therefore, this section of the tutorial allows you to pick 
from one of several modules that that cover different form management 
tools.  Select one or more options from the list below.
