=head1 THANKS

This tutorial would not have been possible without the input of many 
different people in the Catalyst community.  In particular, the 
primary author would like to thank:

=over 4

=item *

Sebastian Riedel for founding the Catalyst project.

=item *

The members of the Catalyst Core Team for their tireless efforts to
advance the Catalyst project.  Although all of the Core Team members
have played a key role in this tutorial, it would have never been
possible without the critical contributions of: Matt Trout, for his
unfathomable knowledge of all things Perl and Catalyst (and his
willingness to answer lots of my questions); Jesse Sheidlower, for his
incredible skill with the written word and dedication to improving the
Catalyst documentation; and Yuval Kogman, for his work on the Catalyst
"Auth & Authz" plugins (the original focus of the tutorial) and other
key Catalyst modules.

=item *

Other Catalyst documentation folks like Kieren Diment, Gavin Henry,
and Jess Robinson (including their work on the original Catalyst
tutorial).  

=item *

Kieren Diment for his oversite of Catalyst-related documentation.

=item *

Everyone on #catalyst and #catalyst-dev.

=item *

Louis Moore (who thanks Marcello Romani and Tom Lanyon) for the
PostgreSQL content in the Appendix.

=item *

People who have emailed me with corrections and suggestions on the 
tutorial.  As of the most recent release, this include: Florian 
Ragwitz, Mauro Andreolini, Jim Howard, Giovanni Gigante, William 
Moreno,  Bryan Roach, Ashley Berlin, David Kamholz, Kevin Old, Henning 
Sprang, Jeremy Jones, David Kurtz, Ingo Wichmann, Shlomi Fish, Murray 
Walker, Adam Witney and xenoterracide.  Thanks to Devin Austin for 
coming up with an initial version of a non-TTSite wrapper page.  
Also, a huge thank you to Kiffin Gish for all the hard work on the 
"database depluralization" effort and Rafael Kitover for the work on 
updating the tutorial to include foreign key support for SQLite.  
I'm sure I am missing some names here... apologies for that (please 
let me know if you name should be here).
